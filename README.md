# Synthetic-Data-Generation-APIs-Integrations
* The ML algorithm will provide the business owners with structured and unstructured data generated synthetically.
* The ML algorithm will predict data using previously stored data generated through simulation. 
* The ML algorithm will project future sales and possible factors that may impact the sales of a business. 
* The ML algorithm reads and stores about 200 - 300 transactions per day with indefinite number of items. 
* The ML algorithm keeps track of the quantity and time of day the different products are sold and keeps count.
* The ML algorithm will store every transaction in a new row with the specific metrics and dimensions.
* The ML ALgorithm will be trained to make sales projection of the business based on the previous yearâ€™s synthetically generated data.
